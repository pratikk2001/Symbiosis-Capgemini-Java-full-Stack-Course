### Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

A specification that defines how the JVM operates, with implementations provided by Oracle and others. The JVM creates a runtime instance whenever a Java program is executed.

### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

JRE provides the runtime environment needed to execute Java applications. It includes a set of libraries and other files that the JVM uses at runtime.

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK is a comprehensive development environment for building Java applications and applets. It includes:

*   JRE
*   Development tools like the interpreter/loader (java), compiler (javac), archiver (jar), and documentation generator (Javadoc).

The JDK comes in different editions:

*   Standard Edition (SE)
*   Enterprise Edition (EE)
*   Micro Edition (ME)
